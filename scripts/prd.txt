### Project: Portfolio Website â€“ Home/About Section Redesign

#### Overview
This update aims to merge the Home and About sections, streamline the hero/title area, and improve the About section's prominence and clarity, while maintaining the existing React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS stack.

---

### Goals

- Merge the Home and About sections into a single homepage, named "About."
- Move the large "Samy Benhassine" text to the upper left, replacing the "SB" logo, but only on the About (homepage).
- In all other sections, display "SB" in the upper left, with a smooth animated transition between "Samy Benhassine" (on About) and "SB" (elsewhere).
- Change the subtitle "Software Engineer & Designer" to "Software Engineer" and make it the main title of the About section, increasing its font size for emphasis.
- Ensure all changes fit seamlessly with the current codebase, using React functional components, hooks, context, and Tailwind CSS for styling and animation.

---

### Requirements

#### 1. Section Merging & Routing
- Remove the separate Home section/component.
- The About section becomes the homepage and is accessible at the root route.
- Navigation and scroll behavior should be updated to reflect this change.

#### 2. Header/Logo Area
- The upper left logo area should display:
  - "Samy Benhassine" (slightly smaller than the current hero font) when on the About (homepage).
  - "SB" (current size) on all other sections.
- Implement a smooth animation (e.g., fade/scale/slide) when transitioning between "Samy Benhassine" and "SB" as the user navigates.
- Ensure the logo/title is always clickable and returns to the About (homepage).

#### 3. About Section Redesign
- The About section should:
  - Serve as the homepage.
  - Use "Software Engineer" as the main title, with a larger font size than before.
  - Remove "Designer" from the subtitle.
  - Retain the personal introduction, avatar, and "View my skills" link.
- Adjust layout and spacing as needed for visual balance.

#### 4. Navigation & Context
- Update navigation buttons and scroll/anchor logic to reflect the merged sections.
- Ensure the theme toggle and other header features remain functional.

#### 5. Animation & Responsiveness
- Use Tailwind CSS and React for all styling and animation.
- Ensure the animated logo/title transition is smooth and accessible.
- Maintain full responsiveness and accessibility across devices.

#### 6. Code Quality
- Use TypeScript for all components.
- Follow existing code patterns and context usage.
- Keep all logic modular and maintainable.

- "Software Engineer" is the About section's main title, styled prominently.
- All navigation, theming, and responsiveness are preserved.
- Code is clean, modular, and consistent with the existing stack.
